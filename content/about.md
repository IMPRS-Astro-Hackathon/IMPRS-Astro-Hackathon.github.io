#### Who can join?

Every IMPRS astronomy student in Heidelberg or Munich can join. We have a limited number of spots, so we will prioritize students who come with their own project, trying to balance a 50/50 split between Heidelberg and Munich students.


#### What is a Hackathon?

In a Hackathon, we want to work together on a project, while also learning new skills and connecting with each other. The concept is similar to [.astronomy](https://www.dotastronomy.com). We will have a mix of Tutorial sessions and Hackathon sessions, giving you time to collaboratively work on joined projects.


### What kind of projects can I bring?

We encourage everyone to propose their own project. You can post your idea as a project our [dripdat](TODO) page. If you want to get some ideas for possible projects, please have a look at our [example projects](TODO).


### How much does it cost?

We do **not** have a registration fee. Students from Munich will have to get their travel expenses and accommodation covered by their own groups. IMPRS can provide support for a limited number of students from Munich. For Heidelberg students there are no expenses.
